    question: "What is missed call text back?",
    answer:
      "Missed call text back automatically sends a text message to anyone whose call your business couldn't answer — so instead of hitting voicemail and moving on, the caller gets an instant reply and can keep the conversation going by SMS.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is SimplAssist?",
    answer:
      "SimplAssist is a customer communication service built for small businesses. The $25/month SMS Only plan gives you missed call text back and a shared inbox, and the $45/month plan adds an AI receptionist for SMS and web chat, a website chat widget, and appointment booking synced with Google Calendar.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does SimplAssist's missed call text back work?",
    answer:
      "When someone calls and you can't pick up, SimplAssist automatically sends them a branded text inviting them to reply. Their replies land in your shared inbox, and on the $45/month plan your AI receptionist can carry the conversation for you.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does SimplAssist cost?",
    answer:
      "SMS Only is $25/month with 500 included SMS parts, and SMS + Web Chat is $45/month with 1,500 included SMS parts. There's a one-time $25 setup fee when you activate paid SMS, which covers your carrier registration. Full Suite is coming soon and can't be purchased just yet.",
  },
  {
    question: "What kinds of businesses is SimplAssist for?",
    answer:
      "SimplAssist is built for small businesses and small teams that get customer calls or website inquiries — the ones too busy serving customers to catch every call. It handles missed-call follow-up, web chat, a shared inbox, and appointment booking, so you get front-desk coverage without hiring a full-time front desk.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does the AI answer with my business's real information?",
    answer:
      "Yes — your AI only speaks from what you've given it. On the SMS + Web Chat plan, SimplAssist loads your business profile, active services, saved FAQs, business hours, and AI settings before every answer, and it's instructed never to invent facts about your business.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does setup take?",
    answer:
      "Most SMS registrations are approved within a few business days of payment, though additional carrier review can sometimes stretch that to a few weeks — that timeline is set by the phone carriers, not by us. Texting goes live as soon as carrier approval and your phone-number assignment are complete. Learn more about what the one-time $25 setup fee covers.",

    answer:
      "Yes — you can cancel anytime, and there are no contracts. The one-time $25 setup fee is non-refundable once carrier registration begins, since it covers that registration process itself.",
