/**
 * Per-business privacy + terms templates (Phase 6).

 * Single source of truth for both:
 *   1. The rendered JSX at /c/[slug]/privacy and /c/[slug]/terms.
 *   2. The "View generated copy" plain-text view in the dashboard Compliance
 *      panel (mode = self_hosted), which customers paste into their own CMS.
 *
 * The privacy template intentionally hits all four carrier-required clauses
 * called out in the Compliance panel's "existing mode" self-check:
 *   1. Explicit mention of SMS/text messaging (Section 3 + 4)
 *   2. "Mobile information will not be shared with third parties for marketing"
 *      (Section 4, last paragraph — verbatim, do not paraphrase)
 *   3. Instructions to opt out via STOP (Section 4)
 *   4. Message frequency varies + msg & data rates may apply (Section 4)
 *
 * If any of these clauses is removed or weakened during edits, the campaign
 * registrations that reference these URLs may be rejected by MNO review.
